# Air-Writing-Dataset
Signal values of air write letters, acquired from IMU motion sensors (gyroscope and accelerometer), are recorded with the subject IDs. 

Steps:
1) load dataset.mat file in matlab environment. dataset covers 3 structure (each is an array): data, letter , user.

   data is an array of matrices where data{i} contains the signal values of the 6 sensors for the i. letter, defined by letter(i), for user(i)

3) Please cite the following papers in order to use the dataset.
